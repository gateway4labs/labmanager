"""
A RLMS plug-in is composed of a module or package, called g4l_rlms_FOO, which
will have a function called get_module(version):

   def get_module(version):
       # ...
       return # the plug-in module for that version

This way, with get_module a single plug-in may support different versions. An
example of an strict version parser would be the following:

   def get_module(version):
       if version.startswith( ('4.', '5.') ):
          import mylab4
          return mylab4
       elif version.startswith('6.'):
          import mylab6
          return mylab6
       else:
          raise ValueError("Version not supported by XXX plug-in: %s" % version)

Although most times, the implementation will simply return the current module, such as:

   def get_module(version):
       return sys.modules[__name__]

The returned module by get_module must have two variables defined, called RLMS
and FORM_CREATOR. So as to do it:

 1. Implement a BaseRLMS-based class, which is essentially a RLMS client.
    This class must be called RLMS.

 2. Implement a BaseFormCreator-based class, which provides the WTForms
    required to store, serialize and validate the RLMS dependent fields.
    There must be an instance of this class at module level called
    FORM_CREATOR.

Finally, the module must call the labmanager.rlms.register() function providing
itself.

So as to develop the RLMS class, the RLMS plug-in can create a Flask blueprint and 
register it. In the case of a plug-in called "foo", it would be:

    from flask import Blueprint
    from labmanager.rlms import register_blueprint

    foo_blueprint = Blueprint('foo', __name__)

    @foo_blueprint.route("/")
    def index():
        return "Hi, this is the index. It will be located in /labmanager/rlms/foo/"

    @foo_blueprint.route("/calendar")
    def calendar():
        return "Here you can use all the Flask system"

    register_blueprint(FOO_blueprint, '/foo/')

The RLMS may also need to access the RLMS.

        reserve will request a new reservation for a username called `username` to a laboratory 
        identified by `laboratory_id`. This identifier was provided by the get_laboratories() method.

        Each LMS/CMS/PLE will have a general configuration. This configuration depends on the 
        particular RLMS.  For example: the WebLab-Deusto RLMS will define a 'time' and a 'priority' 
        fields. Even if the RLMS grants 3600 seconds for one laboratory, the LabManager administrator 
        may have defined that lms1 has maximum only 1800 seconds. These restrictions are provided with 
        the JSON-encoded general_configuration_str.

        The courses where the student is enrolled may have also different configurations each. For 
        example: in the previous case, the lms1 LMS may have 2 courses. While lms1 can use a 
        laboratory for 1800 seconds, they might want to enable course1 to use it for 300 seconds, and
        course2 to use it for 600 seconds. Depending on the LMS, it may be possible to know
        what particular course is being executed. If possible (e.g. in LTI-based systems, such as 
        Moodle >= 2.2), particular_configurations will be a list with a single list with the 
        configuration of that course. If it is not possible (e.g. in Moodle 1.x, < 2.2), 
        particular_configurations will be a list of all the configurations of those courses where
        the student is enrolled in.

        This way, it's up to the RLMS developer to submit to the RLMS a request asking for the best 
        configuration available in the particular_configurations list, as long as it's worse than the
        general_configuration_str. For example, if a user is enrolled in course1 and course2 of lms1,
        the request should ask for 600 seconds (which is the best of course1 and course2, but worse 
        than lms1).
        
        Additional arguments are passed in the form of a dictionary called user_properties. It will include keys such as:
         - full_name
         - from_ip
         - referer
         - user_agent

        Finally, the request_payload argument is a dictionary with the whole request. In particular, 
        it contains a field called 'initial' which is the information submitted by the SCORM object. 
        For instance, if there is a certain initialization argument, it can be passed through this
        field.

        This method must return a dictionary with the following data:

         - 'reservation_id' : A reservation ID (in a str format)

         - 'load_url' : An independent URL where the LMS can redirect the user to and complete the
