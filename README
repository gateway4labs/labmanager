Python 2.7 is required. Do not use Python >= 3

easy_install and pip must be installed. virtualenv is also highly recommended.
Firts, a couple of steps which depend on the operating system:

=== WINDOWS ===

 1. Download easy_install: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads

 1.1 Select the one that is a Windows installer
 1.2 Install it :-)

 2. Put into the PATH the following path: C:\Python27\Scripts\ (if you're using
Python 2.7).

 3. easy_install pip
 4. pip install virtualenv
 5. virtualenv env
 6. env\Scripts\activate.bat

=== LINUX (Ubuntu) ===

 1. sudo apt-get install python-pip python-setuptools python-virtualenv

 2. virtualenv env
 3. . env/bin/activate

=== INSTALL ===

After installing the tools detailed above, you can install the missing
libraries. They will be installed in the "env" directory. Feel free to remove it
at any point.

 1. pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-WTF SQLAlchemy pymySQL pymysql_sa

 2. Copy config.py.dist into config.py

 3. Edit config.py. By default, it uses MySQL, but you can use sqlite if you
 want. If interested in other RDBMS

 3. python deploy.py -cdu



Now you can run it:

python run.py

And see it in http://localhost:5000/
